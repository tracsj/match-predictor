# Forward ledger

Predictions committed before kickoff, graded as results landed. Rewritten from
`predictions/*.csv` on every run, so nothing here is accumulated by hand.

**Read the CLV column first.** Distinguishing a 2% edge from zero needs roughly
43,632 bets at average odds 3.2; CLV converges about a hundred times
faster and is what correctly said stop in the backtest.

**The benchmark changed, and it is not softer.** The settled study graded against
Pinnacle closing, which left the feed in 2026/27. The Betfair Exchange close
replaces it, and on the 16,875 matches carrying both it is an equally accurate
estimate of the truth — de-vigged RPS 0.20404 against Pinnacle's 0.20408 — on a
quarter of the margin, 1.0089 against 1.0389. Its prices run 3.9% longer, so
beating it is if anything harder. CLV below is a like-for-like exchange ratio.

**Exchange ROI below is pre-commission.** 2–5% of net winnings is not deducted,
and that would absorb most of the price advantage. CLV is immune to it, since
both legs are exchange prices and the commission cancels in the ratio.

## Provenance

Each file's commit time against the earliest kickoff it predicts. A file
committed at or after any of its own kickoffs is not graded at all.

**The newest file normally shows `uncommitted` here, and that is correct.**
Grading runs before the commit step, so the file this run just wrote is still
untracked while this table is being built. It is committed moments later, in
the same workflow step that commits this ledger, and grades normally from the
next run onward. Nothing needs fixing.
